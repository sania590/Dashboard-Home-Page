## Notes on Code Integration & Tweaks by Sania

I have added your (Savitabh’s) code into the GitHub repository under the commit message:

**"initial code by frontend developer Savitabh - first version subscribe"**

After the integration, I made a few minor tweaks and pushed another commit:

**"Sania: minor tweaks after first delivery"**

### What I Updated:
- Modified `donotchange.css` and `donotchangejs.js`  
  ➤ I hope these updated files would not interfere with your code.  
  ➤ If they do, please try to refactor your code so the changes apply only to your page.

- Very few changes were made in `style.css` as well.

### Purpose:
I updated the **donotchange.css** and **donotchange.js** files, as these will be added to your page. So if there are any conflicts, they should be resolved at this stage.

---

### Next Steps:
- Once you’ve fixed the remaining issues, please **push your final version with a meaningful commit message**.

Thank you!
